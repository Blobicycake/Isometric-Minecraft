# Isometric-Minecraft
A minecraft addon which allows the world to be seen without (much) depth

When starting a world give all player isometric:flip and isometric:zoom. Drop these items to change the camera angle and zoom.
Keep inventory is reccomended, aiming at enemies (and moving in general) is quite hard. All players have strength II to balance this.
If a player refuses to join with isometric view (but why would they?) give them the tag fpc (first person camera) with `/tag (username) add fpc` and let them reconnect.

**PLEASE SET YOUR FOV TO 30 FOR THE MOST ACCURATE ISOMETRIC EXPERIENCE!**
