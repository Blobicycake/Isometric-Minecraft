# Isometric-Minecraft
A minecraft addon which allows the world to be seen without (much) depth

When starting a world give all players isometric:flip and isometric:zoom. Drop these items to change the camera angle and zoom.
Keep inventory is reccomended so these items aren't lost. Aiming at enemies (and moving in general) is quite hard, all players have strength 2 to balance this.
If a player refuses to join with isometric view (but why would they?) give them the tag fpc (first person camera) with `/tag (username) add fpc` and let them reconnect.

**PLEASE SET YOUR FOV TO 30 FOR THE CAMERA TO WORK CORRECTLY**

*This addon is untested on touchscreen devices. It should perform well but may be difficult to control.*
